# Springboard_Capstone_1

Welcome! This is my first project with machine learning and data science. This project revolves around applying data science and machine learning concepts and tools to predict  or at least try to discover who may be interested in buying Caravan Insurance. The key challenges are that the product is niche as not many people would own a caravan. The data is also imbalance, but I hope this is a good excercise to see how these techniques can be useful in improving selecting a target market or efficiency in marketing. Thank you for stopping by.
